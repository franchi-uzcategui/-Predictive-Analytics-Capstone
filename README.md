# -Predictive-Analytics-Capstone

Predictive Analytics was the capstone project of the Business Analytics Nanodegree at Udacity. The project object was combining predictive techniques learned throughout the course.  A grocery store chain plans an expansion, thus mainly I used segmentation and clustering techniques. First,  to determine the optimal number of clusters for existing stores, I used the K-Centroids diagnostic tool and K-means method, being defined three clusters.            Second, to predict the number of clusters for new stores, we applied the Forest, Decision tree, and Boosted models. The Boosted Model fits to solve the business problem because it has the highest values of accuracy by each cluster.                                                         Third, I compared the performance of ETS and ARIMA model to select one to Predicting Produce Sales. ETS model overall has the best accuracy measures, especially the lowest MASE, MAPE, and RMSE. Therefore, we choose the ETS model to the forecast product sales for the new and existing stores.
